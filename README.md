# Ruby NoMethodError: Handling Missing Methods

This repository demonstrates a common `NoMethodError` in Ruby and shows how to handle it gracefully.

The `bug.rb` file contains code that intentionally causes a `NoMethodError`. The `bugSolution.rb` file provides a solution by adding error handling to prevent the program from crashing.
